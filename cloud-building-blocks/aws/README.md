## 💡 Philosophy

> Success in Data Engineering isn't about knowing *every* button in AWS—it's about knowing which tool is right for the job.

Start small (S3 + Athena), automate (Glue/Lambda), then scale (EMR/Redshift). The cloud is your playground—these are your building blocks.

**Happy engineering!** 🛠️
