| **Day 07** | ML Pipelines & Feature Engineering |
| **Day 08** | Delta Lake & Data Lakehouse |
| **Day 09** | Production Deployment & Cluster Management |

---

### Part 3: Quick Reference
**File:** `03_QUICK_Reference.md`
- Essential commands & syntax
- Common patterns
- Interview Q&A

---

### Part 4: Complete Examples
**File:** `04_Complete_Examples.md`
- ETL Pipeline (CSV → Transform → Parquet)
- Real-time Analytics (Streaming)
- ML Pipeline (Classification)

---

### Part 5: Practice Exercises
**File:** `05_Practice_Exercises.md`
- 5 progressively difficult challenges (no solutions)

---

### Supplemental Guides
| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `06_Installation_Guide.md` | Detailed setup (pip, Docker, Databricks) |
| `07_Performance_Tuning.md` | Optimization deep dive |
| `08_Databricks_Guide.md` | Managed Spark on Databricks |
| `09_Troubleshooting_Extended.md` | Common errors and fixes |
| `10_Delta_Lake_Advanced.md` | Delta Lake patterns |

---

## 🚀 Recommended Workflow

1. **Foundation:** Read `01_Foundation.md` to understand the "why"
2. **Learn:** Complete Days 0-9 sequentially (1-2 hours/day)
3. **Practice:** Build projects from examples
4. **Reference:** Use `03_QUICK_Reference.md` before interviews

**Total Time:** ~20-25 hours for mastery.
