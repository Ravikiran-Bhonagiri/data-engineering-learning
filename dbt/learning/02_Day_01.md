# Day 01: Setup & First Project

**Goal:** Install dbt, configure connection, create first model.

---

## Install dbt

```bash
pip install dbt-postgres  # or dbt-snowflake, dbt-bigquery, etc.
dbt --version
```

---

## Configure Connection

Create `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`:

```yaml
ecommerce_project:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      user: your_username
      password: your_password
      dbname: ecommerce
      schema: dbt_dev
      threads: 4
```

---

## Initialize Project

```bash
dbt init ecommerce_project
cd ecommerce_project
```

This creates:
```
ecommerce_project/
├── dbt_project.yml
├── models/
├── macros/
├── tests/
├── snapshots/
└── seeds/
```

---

## Test Connection

```bash
dbt debug
```

Look for: `Connection test: [OK connection ok]`

---

## Create First Model

**File:** `models/my_first_dbt_model.sql`
```sql
SELECT 1 AS id, 'hello dbt' AS message
```

---

## Run It

```bash
dbt run
```

Output:
```
1 of 1 START sql view model dbt_dev.my_first_dbt_model ..... [RUN]
1 of 1 OK created sql view model dbt_dev.my_first_dbt_model  [SUCCESS]
```

---

## Query the Result

```sql
SELECT * FROM dbt_dev.my_first_dbt_model;
```

Result:
```
id | message
---+-----------
 1 | hello dbt
```

---

## View Documentation

```bash
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve  # Opens localhost:8080
```
