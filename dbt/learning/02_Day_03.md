# Day 03: Sources & Seeds

**Goal:** Define sources and load reference data with seeds.

---

## Define Sources (YAML)

**File:** `models/staging/schema.yml`
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw
    database: ecommerce
    schema: raw
    tables:
      - name: customers
        description: "Raw customer data from production"
        columns:
          - name: id
            tests:
              - unique
              - not_null
      
      - name: orders
        description: "Raw order transactions"
        loaded_at_field: created_at
        freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
```

---

## Use Sources in Models

```sql
-- Instead of: FROM raw.customers
SELECT * FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
```

---

## Check Data Freshness

```bash
dbt source freshness
```

---

## Create a Seed (CSV Reference Data)

**File:** `seeds/product_categories.csv`
```csv
category_id,category_name,department
1,Electronics,Technology
2,Furniture,Office
3,Books,Media
```

---

## Load Seed

```bash
dbt seed
```

---

## Use Seed in Model

```sql
SELECT
    p.name AS product_name,
    pc.category_name,
    pc.department
FROM {{ ref('products') }} p
JOIN {{ ref('product_categories') }} pc 
  ON p.category_id = pc.category_id
```
